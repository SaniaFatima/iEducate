      <p class="sectionSubTag text-sm">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.[2]

Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.</p>

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-sm">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….

We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…

For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a practical.</p>
